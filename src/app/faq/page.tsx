        question: "Do you offer custom rhinestone designs?",

      },
      {
        question: "What colors are available for rhinestones?",

      },
      {
        question: "How do I apply hotfix rhinestones?",
        answer: "For hotfix rhinestones, use a heat source like an iron or heat press. Place the rhinestone on your surface, apply heat for 10-15 seconds, then let it cool. Always test on a scrap piece first."
      },
      {
        question: "What's the best adhesive for flatback rhinestones?",
        answer: "We recommend E6000 or Gem-Tac for fabric applications, and super glue or epoxy for hard surfaces. Always test the adhesive on a small area first to ensure compatibility."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I care for rhinestone jewelry and accessories?",
        answer: "Clean gently with a soft cloth and mild soap. Avoid harsh chemicals, ultrasonic cleaners, and excessive heat. Store in a cool, dry place to prevent damage to the adhesive."
